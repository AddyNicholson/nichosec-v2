# Refund Policy

Due to the digital nature of NichoSecâ€™s threat scanning service and immediate delivery of results, all sales are **final**.

Refunds will only be considered in the following cases:
- The service was not accessible due to technical failure
- You were billed incorrectly

To request a refund, email support@nichosec.com within 7 days of purchase. We do not offer refunds for incorrect usage or false positives/negatives in scan results.
